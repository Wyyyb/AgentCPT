            "text": "Mathematics, Its Origins, and Real World Problems\n\nA Russian mathematician named Sofya Kovalevskaya said, “It is impossible to be a mathematician without being a poet of the soul”. It corroborates with the saying of Galileo Galilei that “Mathematics is the language in which God has written the universe”. When I first heard the quote, I don’t find it as a lucid phrases. As cliche as it sounds, I do believe that mathematics is one of the most important subject in school.\n\nSo, whenever people argue that learning mathematics is worthless and nothing to be gained by just crunching numbers when they grow up, I simply try to assuage, but in the same time not to be a pedant. I am thinking that it is not an anomaly for people to think like that. Mathematics is a difficult subject for some people, even myself. It has a lot of opaque terms, e.g. irrational numbers, logarithm, integral, calculus, etc.\n\nMany people who understand those term must be an erudite person or scholar. But, actually the history of mathematics was inspired by perfunctory activities and not intended to be an equivocal subject. However, in its development, so many invention and formula that ordinary people think of it as overwhelming. There are too many concepts and it is almost impossible to summarize all of mathematics in this page.\n\nIt all start with ancient history or civilization when early humans found ways to count and quantify things. It is the fundamental principle of mathematics, so they do mathematics. In its early application, people will use a tally mark from bone or stick as a rudimentary means to count things. As civilization advanced, people found more application of mathematics in their daily life.\n\nAround 3000 BCE, the Sumerians introduced a base-60 numerical system in using pictograph of a cone which means they utilize 60 symbols. There are other different base number systems. For example, the Hindu-Arabic people used a base-10 decimal system. Then, the Babylonian system which used a more complex sexagesimal (base-60) number. In the Babylonian sexagesimal system, they had symbols to represent 1–9. But for 10, they used a different symbol. They use those symbols and addition/multiplication to represent a symbol. For example, 22 was written as (2x10)+2. If you have learn French, maybe you feel some familiarity with the method.\n\nIn Mesoamerica, the Mayan civilization used a base-20 (vigesimal) number system. It was a number system that probably based on the number of fingers of human. Vigesimal were also used in French, Irish, and Welsh. In English, a score is 20, for instance fourscore years which means 80 years.\n\nOur modern numeration was adopted from Hindu-Arabic decimal system which is originated from India. The system then refined by the Arab in the 9th century and Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) popularized the use of those symbol in Europe through his book Liber Abaci (1202). Contradictory to common belief that it is Europe which start the advancement of mathematics, it is actually Asia and Middle East, then adopted by the European.\n\nOne of the oldest concept in Mathematics is algebra. It developed in Egypt as the Berlin papyrus records a quadratic equation solved in Egypt. In the 7th century, the Indian mathematician, Brahmagupta, solves quadratic equations using only positive integers. The 10th century Egyptian scholar Abu Kamil Shuja ibn Aslam uses negative and irrational numbers to solve quadratic equation.\n\nQuadratic equation is part of algebra which involves unknown number symbolises as ‘x’. It is possible that these equations first arose from the problem to subdivide land. As we can see, I want to conclude this article with a quote from “The Maths Book”. It is said, “one of the rudiments of mathematics is the ability to use equations to work out solutions to real-world problems”.\n\nSource: Dupont, E., et al. The Maths Book. DK, 2019.",

Here's an example of how to use DoWhy for causal inference, focusing on price and sales, while controlling for other factors like promotions, holidays, and seasonality.\n\nInstall Required Libraries:\n\nYou’ll need to install the following packages if you don’t have them:\n\npip install dowhy pandas numpy statsmodels matplotlib seaborn\n\nExample Code using DoWhy:\n\nimport pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np \nimport dowhy \nfrom dowhy import CausalModel \nimport dowhy.datasets \nimport statsmodels.api as sm \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport seaborn as sns \n \n# Step 1: Simulating Data \nnp.random.seed(42) \n \nweeks = 100 \ndf = pd.DataFrame({ \n    'week': np.arange(weeks), \n    'price': np.random.uniform(8, 15, size=weeks),  # Random prices between $8 and $15 \n    'promotion': np.random.choice([0, 1], size=weeks, p=[0.7, 0.3]),  # 30% of weeks have a promotion \n    'holiday': np.random.choice([0, 1], size=weeks, p=[0.8, 0.2]),  # 20% of weeks are holidays \n    'seasonality': np.sin(np.linspace(0, 3 * np.pi, weeks))  # Seasonal trend \n}) \n \n# Simulate sales with some noise and elasticity of price = -1.5 \ndf['sales_units'] = (1000 * (df['price'] ** -1.5)  \n                     + 200 * df['promotion']  \n                     + 100 * df['holiday'] \n                     + 300 * df['seasonality']  \n                     + np.random.normal(0, 50, size=weeks)) \n \n# Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) \nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) \nsns.scatterplot(x='price', y='sales_units', data=df) \nplt.title('Price vs Sales Units') \nplt.show() \n \n# Step 3: Building a Causal Model using DoWhy \n# Define the causal graph: Price is the treatment, and sales_units is the outcome. \n# Promotion, holiday, and seasonality are confounders. \ncausal_graph = \"\"\" \ndigraph { \n    price -> sales_units; \n    promotion -> sales_units; \n    holiday -> sales_units; \n    seasonality -> sales_units; \n    promotion -> price; \n    holiday -> price; \n    seasonality -> price; \n} \n\"\"\" \n \n# Create a DoWhy CausalModel object \nmodel = CausalModel( \n    data=df, \n    treatment='price', \n    outcome='sales_units', \n    graph=causal_graph \n) \n \n# View the causal graph \nmodel.view_model() \n \n# Step 4: Identify the Causal Effect \n# DoWhy will automatically suggest an estimation method based on the data. \nidentified_estimand = model.identify_effect() \n \n# Step 5: Estimate the Causal Effect using Regression \nestimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, \n                                 method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\") \n \n# Print the result \nprint(\"Causal Estimate: \", estimate.value) \n \n# Step 6: Refutation Testing (Checking Robustness of the Result) \n# Refute the estimate by adding random confounders to check robustness \nrefutation = model.refute_estimate(identified_estimand, estimate, method_name=\"random_common_cause\") \nprint(refutation) \n \n# Step 7: Visualize the Results \nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) \nsns.lineplot(x='week', y='sales_units', data=df, label='Sales Units') \nplt.axvline(50, color='red', linestyle='--', label='Price Change Point') \nplt.title('Sales Units Over Time') \nplt.legend() \nplt.show()\n\nExplanation:\n\nStep 1: Simulating Data\n\n- We generate data for price, promotion, holiday, and seasonality over 100 weeks.\n- Sales units are affected by price, promotion, holiday, and seasonality.\n\nStep 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\n- A scatter plot shows the relationship between price and sales units.\n\nStep 3: Building a Causal Model using DoWhy\n\n- We define a causal graph where price affects sales units, and promotion, holiday, and seasonality are confounders.\n- The causal graph shows the hypothesized relationships between variables.\n\nStep 4: Identify the Causal Effect\n\n- Using DoWhy, we identify the causal effect of price on sales units. The identify_effect method looks at the relationships defined in the graph and suggests how to estimate the causal effect (e.g., using a backdoor adjustment method).\n\nStep 5: Estimate the Causal Effect\n\n- We estimate the causal effect using a linear regression method (backdoor.linear_regression). This method takes into account the confounding variables (promotion, holiday, seasonality).\n\nStep 6: Refutation Testing\n\n- We perform a refutation test by adding a random confounder to test whether the causal effect is robust. This helps ensure that the estimated effect is not due to unobserved factors.\n\nStep 7: Visualizing the Results\n\n- Finally, we visualize the time series of sales units, with a reference point for when a hypothetical price change happens.\n\nSummary:\n\nThis approach gives you a structured way to estimate the causal effect of price on sales, while controlling for other factors like promotions, holidays, and seasonality. The DoWhy package helps by formalizing the causal assumptions and providing tools to validate the results through refutation tests.",
